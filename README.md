# Employee Attrition Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on understanding the factors contributing to employee attrition, the natural process through which employees quit the workforce. The analysis is based on a dataset provided by IBM data scientists, which includes information on approximately 1,470 current and past employees. The dataset contains details about monthly wage, job satisfaction, work-life balance, experience, and other relevant factors.

## Project Description
The primary goal of this project is to examine the elements that contribute to employee attrition. By analyzing the provided dataset, I aim to gain insights into the factors that may influence employees to leave the workforce. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains information about current and past employees, including features such as monthly wage, job satisfaction, work-life balance, experience, and more. The dataset was developed by IBM data scientists and provides valuable information for understanding employee attrition.

## Questions Addressed
This analysis aims to answer several key questions:
1. What are the main factors that correlate with employee attrition?
2. Are there specific features that show a significant difference between employees who stay and those who leave?
3. How does job satisfaction relate to employee attrition?
4. Is there a relationship between work-life balance and employee attrition?
5. What insights can we gain from the data that may help in employee retention strategies?

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The project begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of key features, identify trends, and visualize relationships between variables. By addressing the questions mentioned above, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the factors affecting employee attrition.
